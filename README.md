# Living Worlds SDL (Miyoo)

Recreation/port of the colour cycling demos [Living Worlds](http://www.effectgames.com/demos/worlds/) and [Canvas Cycle](http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/) for SDL1.2 made specifically for the Miyoo Mini. I wrote this about a year ago as practice for C so I don't remember much, but I was pretty happy with the final result.
Some of the source code, mainly for handling palette cycling, is from [jhuckaby/canvascycle](https://github.com/jhuckaby/canvascycle). The artworks used in the demos are copyrighted so are not provided.
